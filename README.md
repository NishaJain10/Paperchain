# Paperchain

This project simulates property ownership and acquisition management using a blockchain network. It allows users to buy, sell, and transfer ownership of virtual properties in a decentralized manner.

## Features

- **Property Listing:** Users can list their properties for sale on the blockchain network.
- **Property Acquisition:** Interested buyers can purchase properties using cryptocurrency.
- **Ownership Transfer:** Owners can transfer ownership of properties to other users.
- **Transaction History:** Transparent record of all property transactions on the blockchain.

## Tech Stack

- **Solidity:** Smart contracts for property ownership management.
- **ReactJS:** Frontend interface for users to interact with the blockchain network.
- **IPC Interplanetary Consensus is a framework that enables on-demand horizontal scalability of networks, by deploying "subnets" running different consensus algorithms depending on the application's requirement
